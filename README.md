# Line Token
Line Token is the simplest practical ERC721 implementation I can think of right now. It is designed to demonstrate a functional ERC721 would work.

Line Token allows a venue to hold a person's place in line or a business to give spots for a limited sale (e.g. Supreme clothing, etc.).

Not only would a person have their space in line, they would be able to sell their space to another participant.

Currently, this implementation is limited to allowing the contract owner to pass out spots in line one-by-one.

Things to Add
- Spot marketplace/auction
- ERC721 Metadata
- Allow users to update their own information
